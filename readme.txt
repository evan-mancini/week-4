The DSNY subdistricts play a critical role in ensuring that New York City remains a clean, healthy, and livable environment for all residents. They enable DSNY to more efficiently manage waste collection and disposal, tailor their operations to the unique needs of each neighborhood, and make informed decisions about resource allocation and staffing. By leveraging data and a subdistrict-based approach, DSNY can help keep the city clean and safe for everyone.

I wanted to create this map to highlight the complex patterns that DSNY operates under to keep the city clean.

This is inspired by a book I'm reading right now: https://www.amazon.com/Picking-Up-Streets-Sanitation-Workers/dp/0374534276

"Picking Up" by Robin Nagle is a book that takes readers on a journey through the world of New York City's sanitation workers, exploring their daily lives and the challenges they face while keeping the city clean. Through personal stories and insightful observations, Nagle offers a unique perspective on the essential role that sanitation workers play in maintaining public health and the livability of urban spaces.

I also used this assignment as an opporunity to practice importing geojson data into a webmap.

More to come!
