The DSNY subdistricts play a critical role in ensuring that New York City remains a clean, healthy, and livable environment for all residents. They enable DSNY to more efficiently manage waste collection and disposal, tailor their operations to the unique needs of each neighborhood, and make informed decisions about resource allocation and staffing. By leveraging data and a subdistrict-based approach, DSNY can help keep the city clean and safe for everyone.
